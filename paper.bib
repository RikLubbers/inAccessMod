	abstract = {Optimising the scale and deployment of community health workers (CHWs) is important for maximizing geographical accessibility of integrated primary health care (PHC) services. Yet little is known about approaches for doing so. We used geospatial analysis to model optimised scale-up and deployment of CHWs in Mali, to inform strategic and operational planning by the Ministry of Health and Social Development. Accessibility catchments were modelled based on travel time, accounting for barriers to movement. We compared geographic coverage of the estimated population, under-five deaths, and plasmodium falciparum (
              Pf
              ) malaria cases across different hypothetical optimised CHW networks and identified surpluses and deficits of CHWs compared to the existing CHW network. A network of 15 843 CHW, if optimally deployed, would ensure that 77.3\% of the population beyond 5 km of the CSCom (community health centre) and CSRef (referral health facility) network would be within a 30-minute walk of a CHW. The same network would cover an estimated 59.5\% of U5 deaths and 58.5\% of
              Pf
              malaria cases. As an intermediary step, an optimised network of 4 500 CHW, primarily filling deficits of CHW in the regions of Kayes, Koulikoro, Sikasso, and Ségou would ensure geographic coverage for 31.3\% of the estimated population. There were no important differences in geographic coverage percentage when prioritizing CHW scale-up and deployment based on the estimated population, U5 deaths, or
              Pf
              malaria cases. Our geospatial analysis provides useful information to policymakers and planners in Mali for optimising the scale-up and deployment of CHW and, in turn, for maximizing the value-for-money of resources of investment in CHWs in the context of the country’s health sector reform. Countries with similar interests in optimising the scale and deployment of their CHW workforce may look to Mali as an exemplar model from which to learn.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              Modelling and assessing the loss of geographical accessibility is key to support disaster response and rehabilitation of the healthcare system. The aim of this study was therefore to estimate postdisaster travel times to functional health facilities and analyse losses in accessibility coverage after Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique in 2019.
            
            
              Setting
              We modelled travel time of vulnerable population to the nearest functional health facility in two cyclone-affected regions in Mozambique. Modelling was done using AccessMod V.5.6.30, where roads, rivers, lakes, flood extent, topography and land cover datasets were overlaid with health facility coordinates and high-resolution population data to obtain accessibility coverage estimates under different travel scenarios.
            
            
              Outcome measures
              Travel time to functional health facilities and accessibility coverage estimates were used to identify spatial differences between predisaster and postdisaster geographical accessibility.
            
            
              Results
              We found that accessibility coverage decreased in the cyclone-affected districts, as a result of reduced travel speeds, barriers to movement, road constraints and non-functional health facilities. In Idai-affected districts, accessibility coverage decreased from 78.8\% to 52.5\%, implying that 136 941 children under 5 years of age were no longer able to reach the nearest facility within 2 hours travel time. In Kenneth-affected districts, accessibility coverage decreased from 82.2\% to 71.5\%, corresponding to 14 330 children under 5 years of age having to travel {\textgreater}2 hours to reach the nearest facility. Damage to transport networks and reduced travel speeds resulted in the most substantial accessibility coverage losses in both Idai-affected and Kenneth-affected districts.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Postdisaster accessibility modelling can increase our understanding of spatial differences in geographical access to care in the direct aftermath of a disaster and can inform targeting and prioritisation of limited resources. Our results reflect opportunities for integrating accessibility modelling in early disaster response, and to inform discussions on health system recovery, mitigation and preparedness.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Poor access to immunisation services remains a major barrier to achieving equity and expanding vaccination coverage in many sub-Saharan African countries. In Kenya, the extent to which spatial access affects immunisation coverage is not well understood. The aim of this study was to quantify spatial accessibility to immunising health facilities and determine its influence on immunisation uptake in Kenya while controlling for potential confounders.
            
            
              Methods
              Spatial databases of immunising facilities, road network, land use and elevation were used within a cost friction algorithim to estimate the travel time to immunising health facilities. Two travel scenarios were evaluated; (1) Walking only and (2) Optimistic scenario combining walking and motorized transport. Mean travel time to health facilities and proportions of the total population living within 1-h to the nearest immunising health facility were computed. Data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey (KDHS 2014), was used to estimate the effect of mean travel time at survey cluster units for both fully immunised status and third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DPT3) vaccine using multi-level logistic regression models.
            
            
              Results
              Nationally, the mean travel time to immunising health facilities was 63 and 40 min using the walking and the optimistic travel scenarios respectively. Seventy five percent of the total population were within one-hour of walking to an immunising health facility while 93\% were within one-hour considering the optimistic scenario. There were substantial variations across the country with 62\%(29/47) and 34\%(16/47) of the counties with {\textless} 90\% of the population within one-hour from an immunising health facility using scenarios 1 and 2 respectively. Travel times {\textgreater} 1-h were significantly associated with low immunisation coverage in the univariate analysis for both fully immunised status and DPT3 vaccine. Children living more than 2-h were significantly less likely to be fully immunised [AOR:0.56(0.33–0.94) and receive DPT3 [AOR:0.51(0.21–0.92) after controlling for household wealth, mother’s highest education level, parity and urban/rural residence.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Travel time to immunising health facilities is a barrier to uptake of childhood vaccines in regions with suboptimal accessibility ({\textgreater} 2-h). Strategies that address access barriers in the hardest to reach communities are needed to enhance equitable access to immunisation services in Kenya.},
